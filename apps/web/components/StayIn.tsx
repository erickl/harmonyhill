                        and
                        glimpsing tropical birds fly through the misty valley. They make their way to the <b>rice
                            paddies</b> to hunt for breakfast.
                        <br/>... Why not follow suit? Wander through the paddies, down to a <b>secluded waterfall</b> for a
                        morning dip, just 5 minutes walk away.

                        <br/>... Stroll around our <b>tropical fruit garden</b> and learn about the various plants
                        <br/>... Have a <b>Balinese massage</b> or a <b>yoga className</b> with a private instructor on the
                        wooden deck (extra charge)
