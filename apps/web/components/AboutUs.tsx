                <p>Harmony Hill and The Jungle Nook are our luxurious villas, tucked away in a traditional village in the
                    heart of Bali. Perched upon
                    a ridge, overlooking a gorgeous valley and luscious rice fields, we are a scenic 30 minute drive away
                    from
                    both the bustling town of Ubud in the South and the jaw dropping volcanic landscapes of Mount Batur in
                    the North.
