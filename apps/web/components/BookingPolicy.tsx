                • <strong>Location:</strong> We are about <strong>30 minutes north of Ubud</strong> in a traditional village.<br />
                • <strong>AC:</strong> As we are at a higher elevation, <strong>we do not need air conditioning</strong> and instead rely on
                natural ventilation and fans.<br />
                • <strong>Meals:</strong> We are <strong>100% vegan</strong> and all our dishes are plant-based.<br />
                • <strong>Local wildlife:</strong> We are <strong>sometimes visited by cicadas</strong>. They're about the size of your thumb but they
                screech at impressively high volume. Guests should be prepared to hear them a few hours per day.
